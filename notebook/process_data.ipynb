       "\"Tikki Tikki Tembo {Full name Tikki tikki tembo-no sa rembo- chari bari ruchi-pip peri pembo} is a 1968 picture book written by Arlene Mosel and illustrated by Blair Lent. The book tells the story of a Chinese boy with a long name who fell into a well. It is a sort of origin myth about why Chinese names are so short today. The book is controversial because it appears to retell a Japanese story and because it does not portray Chinese culture accurately. Plot Tikki Tikki Tembo is set in ancient China and invents an ancient Chinese custom whereby parents honor their first-born sons with long, elaborate names that everyone is obliged to say completely - no nicknames, no shortening of any kind - while second-born sons are typically given short, unimportant names. A boy named Tikki Tikki Tembo-no Sa Rembo-chari Bari Ruchi-pip Peri Pembo (``The Most Wonderful Thing in the Whole Wide World '') and his little brother Chang (`` Little or Nothing'') are playing very close to a well at their house that their mother has warned them to avoid. Chang falls in the well and his older brother runs to their mother and tells her Chang has fallen down the well. Their mother tells him to get the Old Man with the Ladder. He goes and tells the old man. Chang is rescued and then recovers quickly. Some time later, the boys are again playing near the well. This time, the older brother falls in. Chang runs to their mother and tries to tell her that ``Tikki Tikki Tembo-no Sa Rembo-chari Bari Ruchi-pip Peri Pembo has fallen\""
